# Stochastic Gradient Descent / Online Learning for Machine Learning

This code was built for Machine Learning Lecture Assignment. This program used Iris Dataset to perform online learning method, in addition, Sigmoid Activation Function was used to do classification toward the data class, to calculate and find global minimum of error value.
